However, there is a minimum requirement of [TODO] KMS Tokens to be a Cryptolympic Promoter.  You will only gain the referral dividends if you hold these tokens when your referred Runner takes the Torch.</p>

                                <p>Since this is a Proof-of-Stake Token, you will only earn dividends as long as you hold Tokens and the amount of dividends is directly related to the number of Tokens you hold.</p>
